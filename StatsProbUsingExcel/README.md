# Essential Statistics for Data Analysis using Excel
This course will help you gain a solid understanding of statistics and basic probability that forms a foundation for further work in data analysis and data science.

## Module 1: Descriptive Statistics
You will learn how to describe data using charts and basic statistical measures. Full use will be made of the new histograms, Pareto charts, Boxplots, and Treemap and Sunburst charts in Excel 2016.

## Module 2: Basic Probability
You will learn basic probability including the law of complements, independent events, conditional probability and Bayes Theorem.

## Module 3: Random Variables
You will learn how to find the mean and variance of random variables and then learn about the binomial, Poisson, and Normal random variables. We close with a discussion of the beautiful and important Central Limit Theorem.

## Module 4: Sampling and Confidence Intervals
You will learn the mechanics of sampling, point estimation, and interval estimation of population parameters.

## Module 5: Hypothesis Testing
You will learn null and alternative hypotheses, Type I and Type II error, One sample tests for means and proportions, Tests for difference between means of two populations, and the Chi Square Test for Independence.
