# What is this directory about?
- This directory is where I attempt real analytics examples
- There will be 4 main parts:
    1. Visualisation
    2. Modeling
    3. Data Preparation
    4. Communication
- Pathways:
    1. independent
    2. Full Monty (go as it's laid out) (I'm going with this one)
    3. sequential (data prep -> visualiation -> modelling -> presentation)
    4. The Explorer (Visualisation -> Presentation)
    5. Modeller (Data prep -> modelling)
        - for those tasked in daily jobs create models and deploy them
    6. The senior (visualiation -> modelling -> presentation)
        - sr. data scientists who has grunts doing data prep for them
    7. Reporting services (Data prep -> presentation)
        - getting the data, putting in right place, and present to right people
