#Visualization!

## Installations
- Let's install Tableau first by going to: 
    - [tableau desktop](https://www.tableau.com) for paid version
    - [tableau public](https://public.tableau.com/s/) for free version
        - you need to enter your e-mail adress and begin download
        - Interface and layouts are mostly the same and will be more than enough for this whole course
        - unless you want only 14 days for trial and then pay for the other version

## DATA Sets
- we can grab data sets from [superdatascience](https://superdatascience.com/training "data science for beginners")
    - we grab the office supplies file first under visualisations
