#Notes for Tableau data mining
- I didn't like having a captions in the worksheets so I have to compromise with this

## Starting out
1. go to [Part 1. Visualization Section 2](https://www.superdatascience.com/training/)
    - download churn modeling which is an Excel Sheet
2. Now open Tableau and Connect with that Excel Sheet
3. Let's test out Geography and when you drag into rows, you just see a simple table
    - we can change by going into dimensions->Geography->Geographic Roles -> Country/Region
    - Now you see the geography of those countries we're working with
4. Add colors to country by dragging `Number of Records` over Color
    - We can see numbers of customers by country by dragging over to Label
