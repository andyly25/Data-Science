# Simple calculations
3+4
3*4
3/4
3^4
3+4*3/4

# Here we'll use functions usually have () at the end
sqrt(25)

# If unsure what a function does, you'll do ?functionName
# This brings up help window to the right side
?sqrt

# Here is how you define some number x to use as a variable (using '<-' )
x <- 5 
x + 2
y <- x^2

# simple quiz? R can be used as a basic calculator. What will R return when the following value is typed in the console window?
#1 
6^2+2
#2 You can assign values to objects in R. Which of the following lines of code assigns the value 6^2+2 to the object x?
x <- 6^2+2
#3 What value would R return if you called your new object, x, in the following line of code?
x^2
#4 When you create an object in R Studio, where does that object (and its contents) appear?
# In the: Workspace/environment

#5 You can write comments in your code to help you remember what each line of code does. What symbol precedes a comment?
# it is the '#' or pound symbol

#6 Look at the following line of code. What would you see in the console window after running this code?
#Assign the value 6+2 to x
x <- 6+2
# You would see the two lines of code exactly as they appear here. correct

#7 If you want R to return the value of x in the console window, what additional line of code would you need to add?
x

#8 The following line of code is an example of what?
sqrt(x^2)
# a function

#9 What value would R return for sqrt(x^2)?
# it would display 8 or whatever x is (square root something being squared is same number)
