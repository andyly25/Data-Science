## Module 1: Descriptive Statistics
You will learn how to describe data using charts and basic statistical measures. Full use will be made of the new histograms, Pareto charts, Boxplots, and Treemap and Sunburst charts in Excel 2016.
Lessons: 

- Defining Data
- Histograms and Skewness
- Descriptive Statistics with Analysis ToolPak
- Boxplots
- Categorical Data, PivotTables, and PivotCharts
- Summarizing Hierarchical Data
- 80-20 Rule and Pareto Charts

## Module 2: Basic Probability
You will learn basic probability including the law of complements, independent events, conditional probability and Bayes Theorem.

- Introduction to Probability
- Law of Complements
- Mutually Exclusive and Independent Events
- Conditional Probability
- Law of Total Probability and Bayes Rule

## Module 3: Random Variables
You will learn how to find the mean and variance of random variables and then learn about the binomial, Poisson, and Normal random variables. We close with a discussion of the beautiful and important Central Limit Theorem.

- Random Variable Definitions
- Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation of a Random Variable
- Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation for Sum of Random Variables
- Binomial Random Variable
- Poisson Random Variable
- Normal Random Variable
- Central Limit Theorem
- Z Scores


## Module 4: Sampling and Confidence Intervals
You will learn the mechanics of sampling, point estimation, and interval estimation of population parameters.

- Populations and Samples
- Point Estimation of a Population Mean and Proportion
- The Standard Normal
- Confidence Interval Estimation
- Sample Size Determination
- The Finite Correction Factor

## Module 5: Hypothesis Testing
You will learn null and alternative hypotheses, Type I and Type II error, One sample tests for means and proportions, Tests for difference between means of two populations, and the Chi Square Test for Independence.

- Defining Hypothesis
- Type I and Type II Errors
- One Sample Z-Test
- One Sample T-Test
- Single Sample Test for Population Proportion
- Testing Equality of Variances
- Testing the Difference Between Two Population Means
- Chi-Squared Test for Independence
